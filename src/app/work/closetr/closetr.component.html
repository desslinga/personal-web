      <h3>What it is</h3>
      <p>Closetr is a closet tracker that helps you have a better sense of your style,
      and spending. We want to make it easier to know what to wear next, and to give
      you insight on which clothes work (and don't work) for you.</p>
      <h3>Why we made this</h3>
      <h4>... a tool that we needed.</h4>
      <p>Our team is two people who have different relationships with personal style, as
      well as different approaches to maintaining each of our closets.</p>
      <p>Closetr is meant to help with organizing your closet, whether you have too much
      or too little. We provide insights and simple analytics that help you make your
      next decisions: be it purchases, what to wear today, or what you might need to
      discard. We made this tool to help us, and hopefully it helps you too!</p>
      <h4>... a project to help us learn.</h4>
      <p>We also wanted to get started on a project together and learn how to build a
      web application with a new stack we have no previous experience on.</p>
      <h3>Core functionality</h3>
      <p>There were a ton of things we wanted Closetr to do for us, but we decided to
      start out with the things (dubbed "widgets") that were most important.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Closet Widget</strong>
        First, the obvious: we wanted to keep track of what's in our closet. This
        feature allowed us to add new clothes in our closet, and then look through them
        (with basic filters and sorts too). Basic maintenance functions such as editing
        deleting are included too.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Spending Widget</strong>
        The second widget tracks spending. Keeping within a budget was important to us
        when it came to buying clothes, so we wanted this widget to help keep us
        accountable. It would list what we've purchased during the last month (or whatever
        period of time), and let us know if we're still in budget.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Today Widget</strong>
        This widget makes everyday decisions about clothing easier. It tells you the
        weather, which hopefully will help with dressing more appropriately for it. You
        can also log what you're wearing for a particular day, which over time will tell
        you about your style: what you tend to wear (and otherwise.)</p></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Look and feel</h3>
      <p>When coming up with the design for Closetr, we knew we wanted to start with
      something simple and friendly. We liked flat designs with meaningful interactions,
      which was the principle we went by in designing the initial screens for our
      web application.</p>
      <p>Without explaining too much, here are the mockups we've generated for Closetr:</p>

      <p>These were the initial designs we made for Closetr. We know that nothing is set
      in stone at this point. In the future, we would like to make it a project to
      create a cohesive design for Closetr. We're inspired by Material Design; putting
      intention behind design, and would like to apply that to Closetr as we develop
      it.</p>
      <h3>Our Progress</h3>
      <p>Our team thought of this idea around October 2018. We spent our first month and
      some in the ideation stage. We came up with our requirements through creating
      personas and user stories, and grounded those out into projects and tasks.</p>
      <p>During this process of ideation and requirement gathering, we chose our
      technology (Angular, Node, Express, and MongoDB). We also designed our UIs for the
      web-app, as we are first targeting to release Closetr on the web. We also plan
      on making Closetr available for iOS. For now, this is a distant project for us,
      but we're designing web-app to be mobile-first to help keep us in check.</p>
