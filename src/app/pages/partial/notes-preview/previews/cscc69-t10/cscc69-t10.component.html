        This tutorial will be an overview of <b>Assignment 3</b>. You will have to implement 
        commands for manipulating the file system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>ls</code>: List the files in the given directory. If the <code>-a</code>
          flag is given, then we also show hidden files such as <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>mkdir</code>: Create a directory in the given path.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>cp</code>: Copies the contents of the specified file into the new 
          destination path with the new specified name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>ln</code>: Creates a soft link of a specified file to the new destination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>rm</code>: Removes the file in the specified path. This one is a bonus and 
          won't be discussed here, but feel free to ask me about it privately.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that there is no starer code, but 
        <a href="">readimage.c</a> should be good to get you started. As with readimage.c,
        One of the arguments that you pass into any of the commands is the file name of the 
        disk image.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3><code>ext2_ls</code></h3>
      <b>Usage: <code>ext2_ls &lt;image file name&gt; &lt;file path&gt; [-a]</code></b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>file path</code>: The name of the directory/file that we want to list 
          the contents of.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>hidden flag [-a]</code>: If this flag is specified then we also want to 
          display hidden entries (for the directory), such as <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this command (as with the others), you will have to do a lot of validation.
        This includes checking the path name given. For this case, you will have to check
        if the disk image is valid, and the path name is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have to ensure that you return an error for paths such as
        <code>/not//..//valid///path</code>. It would be better to define a helper 
        function for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if the path is valid, there are two cases. The path either points to
        a directory, or a file.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>File Case</b>: Get to the inode of the file, and retrieve it's name. Then 
        print the name of the file (excluding the path).
      </p>
      <pre class="language-clike">&gt; ext2_ls disk.img path/to/file.txt
file.txt</pre>
      <p>
        <b>Directory Case</b>: We then have two sub-cases. We either have the 
        <code>-a</code> flag, or not. Either way, we would similarly retrieve the inode 
        for the directory. <b>Hint:</b> define a helper function that returns the inode 
        number when given a path name. From the inode, we locate the block with the 
        directory entries.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use <code>rec_len</code> to traverse through the files that we see, and add 
        them to a list. If the <code>-a</code> flag is given, then we also add the entries 
        <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> to our list. We print these entries line by line.
      </p>
      <pre class="language-clike">&gt; ext2_ls disk.img path/to/directory
file1.txt 
file2.txt 
file3.txt</pre>
      <pre class="language-clike">&gt; ext2_ls disk.img path/to/directory -a
.
..
file1.txt 
file2.txt 
file3.txt</pre>
      <hr>
      <h3><code>ext2_mkdir</code></h3>
      <b>Usage: <code>ext2_ls &lt;image file name&gt; &lt;new directory path&gt;</code></b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>new directory path</code>: The path including the destination to place the 
          new directory, and the name of the new directory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this command, you will actually have to manipulate the file system. As usual, 
        you will have to do some validation on the new directory path name provided. For 
        example, let's say we are given the following directory path.
      </p>
      <pre class="language-clike">ext2_mkdir path/to/new/directory</pre>
      <p>
        We would attempt to extract the parent path, and the name of the new directory.
        For this example, we can do that. <code>path/to/new/</code> should be the parent 
        directory for your new directory named <code>directory</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we would need to create the new directory. First, we would need to consult 
        the <code>inode_bitmap</code> for a free inode, and <code>block_bitmap</code> for 
        a free block. We will increment the appropriate inode, and block counters. Then, 
        we need to set the information in our new inode to reflect the new directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the new directory block for <code>directory</code>, we would need to add the
        default two entries <code>.</code>, <code>..</code>. <b>Hint:</b> create a helper 
        function that adds a directory entry to a given directory block.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would need to check if <code>path/to/new</code> is the path of a valid directory.
        Otherwise, we need to return the appropriate error. Next, we create a new directory 
        entry in the parent inode, named <code>directory</code>. We set this directory entry 
        with the new block and inode we allocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any one of the above steps fails, then we would need to restore the counters and
        bitmaps that we modified. <b>Hint:</b> create a helper function that does this 
        for you.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3><code>ext2_cp</code></h3>
      <b>Usage: <code>ext2_cp &lt;image file name&gt; &lt;native OS file path&gt; &lt;disk file path&gt;</code></b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>native OS file path</code>: The path in our native OS file system that 
          contains the file that we want to copy. Note that we cannot copy directories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>disk file path</code>: The directory in the disk file <code>image file name</code>
          where we want to store the contents we copied.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This command is more complicated than the previous two. There are some validations 
        that we need to do, such as checking the file name in the native system. If the file 
        name is too long, for example, then we would return <code>ENAMETOOLONG</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this example, we will assume that we have used the command like so:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-clike">ext2_cp disk.img path/big_file.txt /level1/level2</pre>
      <p>
        We would need to extract the file name from <code>path/big_file.txt</code>, as this 
        would be the name of the file in the destination directory. The name would be 
        <code>big_file.txt</code>. Then, we would need to check how large the file is that we 
        are copying. From the size of the file, we can calculate how many blocks we need to store it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there are possible errors we need to watch out for. For example, if there are 
        not enough free blocks for the file. However, if there are enough blocks available, then 
        we can proceed copying the contents of our file into those blocks. Note that the first 12 
        blocks are direct blocks, and beyond that, we would need to use secondary blocks. After 
        copying the file contents of <code>big_file.txt</code>, we would allocate an inode for 
        this new file, and name it appropriately.
      </p>

      <img src="./assets/images/notes/cscc69_t10_1.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-12">
      <p>
        After we have succesfully copied the file contents, and allocated an inode, then we need to 
        add a new directory entry to <code>/level1/level2</code>. We would need to check that 
        <code>/level1/level2</code> is a valid directory, and if it is, then we get it's inode.
        We get the directory block, and add a new directory entry named <code>big_file.txt</code>.
        We would need to note the number of new blocks used, and the new inode.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any one of the above steps fails, then we would need to restore the counters and
        bitmaps that we modified. Recall the helper function suggested earlier.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3><code>ext2_ln</code></h3>
      <b>Usage: <code>ext2_ln &lt;image file name&gt; &lt;source link path&gt; &lt;destination link path&gt; [-s]</code></b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>source link path</code>: The path in our disk for the file we want to create a 
          link for.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>destination link path</code>: The destination path for our new link. The last 
          name for the link, and the parent directory path, are both included here.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>symbolic link flag -s</code>: If this flag is given, then we create a symbolic 
          link. Otherwise, we create a hard link.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This one should be a bit easier than <code>ext2_cp</code>, but there's still some work 
        to be done. One of the differences is that the <code>destination link path</code> is the 
        path of the new link, rather than the parent directory. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For this example, we will assume that we have used the command like so:
      </p>
      <pre class="language-clike">ext2_ln disk.img path/big_file.txt /level1/level2/newlink</pre>
      <p>
        This means we are creating a link to <code>path/big_file.txt</code>. The link will be 
        named <code>newlink</code> and is placed in the <code>/level1/level2</code> directory.
        Since the <code>-s</code> flag is omitted, we create a hard link.
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual validations will apply. For example, we have to ensure that 
        <code>/level1/level2/</code> is a directory, and that an entry <code>newlink</code> 
        does not yet exist in that directory. We also have to ensure that the new link name 
        isn't too long (as with <code>ext2_cp</code>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since we are creating a hard link, then our task is simple. We simply 
        have to create a new directory entry in <code>/level1/level2</code>, named 
        <code>big_file.txt</code>, pointing to the same inode as <code>path/big_file.txt</code>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-12">
      <img src="./assets/images/notes/cscc69_t10_2.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="col-12">
      <p>
        What about the case where we want to create a symbolic link? This would be if the 
        <code>-s</code> flag is given.
      </p>
      <pre class="language-clike">ext2_ln disk.img path/big_file.txt /level1/level2/newlink [-s]</pre>
      <p>
        This case is a bit more complicated, but the extra work is simply allocating a 
        new inode. Once we allocate an inode, we need to find a block for the symbolic 
        link. Then, we write the path of the original file: <code>path/big_file.txt</code>
        into that block. As with the hard link case, we need to create a new directory 
        entry <code>newlink</code> in <code>level1/level2</code>. However, this entry 
        points to the new inode we made.
