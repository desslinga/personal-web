        1. What does a <defn>DOCTYPE</defn> do?

      <p>
        Short form of <defn>Document Type</defn>, it specifies which <defn>

      </p>
      <p>
        For the case of web-pages, you can specify which <defn>HTML version
        </defn> the document follows. To specify that an html file respects
        <defn>HTML5 standards</defn>, we declare <code class="language-html">
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. If the <defn>DOCTYPE</defn> is not
        specified, then <defn>quirks mode</defn> will be triggered. In
        <defn>quirks mode</defn>, content may display in unexpected ways. If
        it is specified, then <defn>no-quirks mode</defn> is activated.

        2. How do you serve a page with content in

      </h3>
      <p>
        When an <defn>HTTP request</defn> is sent to a server, the request
        usually contains info about language preferences, like the
        <code>Accept-Language</code> header. The server uses this information
        to return a version of the HTML document to match the language needed.
        Usually, the html will have an attribute <code>lang</code>.
        E.g. <code class="language-html">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
        </code>

      </h3>
      <p>
        A method of storing <defn>extra data</defn> before JavaScript frameworks
        became more mainstream. Using <code>data-</code> attributes allowed to

      <h3>6. Describe the difference between a <defn>cookie</defn>,
        <defn>sessionStorage</defn>, and <defn>localStorage</defn>.</h3>
      <p>
        All three are key-value storage options on the client side. They can
        store values as strings (must use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse for
        objects).
      </p>
      <p>
        <defn>cookie</defn>: <defn>Client or server</defn> can initiate storage.
        Servers must use <code>Set-Cookie</code> header. Data expiry is <defn>
        set by initiator</defn>, and can be set to persist across browser
        sessions (or otherwise). Cookies are sent to server with every HTTP
        request, with a <code>Cookie</code> header. They can hold<defn>4kb per
        domain</defn>, and are accessible by <defn>any window</defn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <defn>localStorage</defn> and <defn>sessionStorage</defn> similarities:
        Initiated on the <defn>client</defn> side. Data stored in either are
        not sent to server with every HTTP request. They both store
        <defn>5 MB per domain</defn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <defn>localStorage</defn>: Once set, <defn>lasts forever</defn> (until
        removed by user or some application), thus it is <defn>persistent</defn>
        across browser sessions. It is accessible by <defn>any window</defn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <defn>sessionStorage</defn>: Once set, lasts until <defn>tab
        closes</defn>. Data doesn't persist across browser sessions, and is
        only accessible by the <defn>same tab</defn> in a window.

      <p>
        CSS : When placing <code class="language-html">&lt;link&gt;</code>
        inside the <code class="language-html">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code>
        tags, then the HTML and CSS are being <defn>parsed simultaneously</defn>.
        Both the <defn>DOM</defn> and <defn>CSSOM</defn> are created, and
        used to create the website visuals. It also allows for <defn>progressive
        rendering</defn>. If the CSS link is placed at the bottom, the
        styles are <defn>parsed after</defn> the HTML is... which will prevent
        <defn>progressive rendering</defn> in many browsers. This is because
        browsers block rendering so as to not have to restyle elements as
        their styles change.

      <p>
        SCRIPT : Using just <code class="language-html">&lt;script&gt;</code>
        <defn> halts HTML parsing</defn> until the script has been
        <defn>downloaded</defn>. This means users have to wait
        (not good), so the solution is to load scripts after HTML is parsed,
        before the ending <code class="language-html">&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.
        Using <code class="language-html">&lt;script defer&gt;</code> in the
        <code class="language-html">&lt;head&gt;</code> is better and achieves
        the same effect, but there are a few browsers that don't support it.

        <defn>Progressive rendering</defn> is are the sets of techniques to

      <h3>
        10. Why would you use a <code>srcset</code> attribute in an image tag?
        Explain how the browser evaluates the content of this attribute.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Using <code>srcset</code> is for when we want to use differently sizes images
        depending on the user's device width. We display higher resolution
        images for higher resolution displays, and otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
         Use it like so: <code class="language-html"> &lt;img srcset="small.png
         500w, medium.png 1000w, large.png 2000w" src="..."&gt;</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the number beside <code>w</code> denotes the width of that image
        in pixels. Then for device width of 400px, srcset makes these
        calculations:
      </p>
      <p><defn>
        500/400 = 1.25
        <br>
        1000/400 = 2.5
        <br>
        2000/400 = 5
      </defn></p>
      <p>
        And it chooses the image for which the evaluated number is closest to 1.
        That would be small.png with 1.25 for this case.
