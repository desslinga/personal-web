      <h3>1. What is <defn>CSS selector specificity</defn> and how does
        it work? </h3>
      <p>
        Specificity is a property of each CSS rule that has matched a
        particular element. For this, we assume that the browser knows which
        CSS rules match some particular element. The specificity for these
        matched rules are determined by four comma-separated values:
        <defn>(a, b, c, d)</defn>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <defn>a: </defn>
            1 if the rule is an inline style, 0 otherwise.
            <br>
            <code class="language-html">&lt;h1 style="color: #fff"&gt;</code>
            would get a score of <defn>a = 1</defn>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <defn>b: </defn>
            number of ID selectors.
            <br>
            <code class="lang-css">#card #small &#123; &#125;</code> has two id selectors,
            getting a score of <defn>b = 2</defn>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <defn>c: </defn>
            number of classes, attributes, and pseudo-class selectors.
            <br>
            <code class="language-css">.select-container .selector input[type="text"] &#123; &#125;</code>
            has two class selectors <code>.select-container</code> and
            <code>.selector</code>, and one attribute selector <code>[type="text"]</code>,
            getting a score
            of <defn>c = 3</defn>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <defn>d: </defn>
            number of tags, and pseudo-element selectors.
            <br>
            <code>label:before</code> has one element <code>label</code> and one
            pseudo-element selector <code>:before</code> , getting a score of
            <defn>d = 2</defn>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The resulting specificity for each rule is matched column by column.
        We go from <defn>a</defn> to <defn>d</defn>, and compare which rules
        have the highest value. So, all rules with <defn>a = 1</defn>, override
        all rules with <defn>a = 0 </defn>no matter what each of them get for
        <defn>b</defn>, <defn>c</defn>, or <defn>d</defn>.

        2. What's the difference between <defn>"resetting"</defn> and
        <defn>"normalizing"</defn> CSS? Which would you choose, and why?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <defn>Resetting: </defn> gets completely rid of the default browser
        styling of elements. This means that you have to re-declare all rules
        from scratch, even the basic ones!
      </p>
      <p>
        <defn>Normalizing: </defn> doesn't get rid of all default styling.
        Rather, it keeps the 'useful' ones. It also corrects some browser bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which to choose? Use reset if we are designing an unconventional
        site, and normalize otherwise.

      <h3>
        3. Describe <defn>floats</defn> and how they work.
      </h3>
      <p>
        <defn>Float</defn> is a css positioning property. <code>float</code> can
        take a value of <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> which stick the
        elements in those directions respectively. Floated elements remain in
        the <defn>flow </defn> of a page -- meaning they will affect the
        positioning of other elements. <code>float</code> can also takes values
        <code>none</code> and <code>inherit</code> , which are self explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a floated element A is inline beside a floated element B, you can
        use <code>clear</code> on any one of those elements to move it to the
        next line.
      </p>
      <p>
        If some elements contain only floated elements, then it will have 0
        height. We can fix this in a couple of ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Set the parent's content to <code>overflow: auto</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add an element with <code>clear: both</code> before the close of the
            container
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        4. Describe <defn>z-index</defn>, and how a <defn>stacking context</defn>
        is formed.
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>z-index</code> controls the vertical stacking order of elements.
        They only affect elements that don't have <code>position: static</code>
        (which is the default position property).
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is no <code>z-index</code> specified, then elements are
        stacked in the order that they appear in the DOM (top-level at the
        bottom). Elements that don't have <code>position: static</code> always
        appear on top over those that do.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <defn>stacking context</defn> is a parent element containing more
        elements. The <code>z-index</code> of a <defn>stacking context</defn>'s
        child elements are only relevent within their parent element (read:
        they don't affect other elements outside the
        <defn>stacking context</defn>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many ways to trigger a <defn>stacking context</defn>, such
        as having <code>opacity</code> less than 1, and <code>filter</code> that is
        not <code>none</code>
      </p>

      <h3>5. Describe <defn>Block Formatting Context</defn> and how it works.</h3>
      <p>
        A <defn>Block Formatting Context</defn> is caused by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <code>float</code> value other than <code>none</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <code>position</code> value that isn't <code>static</code> or
            <code>none</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <code>display</code> value of <code>table-cell</code>,
          <code>table-caption</code>, <code>inline-block</code>, or
          <code>inline-flex</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <code>overflow</code> value that isn't <code>visible</code>.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each box element contained inside a <defn>BFC</defn> has its left side
        touching the left edge of the <defn>BFC.</defn>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, vertical margins on stacking elements don't take the sum of the
        margins. Instead, they take only the largest of the two, combining
        them to form a single margin.

      <h3>
        What are the various <defn>clearing</defn> techniques and which is
        appropriate for each context?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is about floated elements. You can clear them by using:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
            An empty <code>div</code> with <code>clear: both</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The <code>clearfix</code> class.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <code>overflow: auto</code> or <code>overflow: hidden</code>, which
            establishes a BFC.
        </p></li>

      <h3>
        How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?

        <li><p>
          A separate stylesheet that loads only for a specific browser.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Libraries that do this for you, such as <defn>Bootstrap</defn>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>

      <h3>
        What are some of "gotchas" for writing efficient CSS?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Browsers <defn>match selectors</defn> from the <defn>right-most
        selector</defn>, then proceeds leftwards. In a selector such as
        <code>.card .title span</code>, the browser tries to match <code>span</code>
        first, and then filters all <code>span</code> elements by
        <code>.title</code>, and so on. This is not good because <code>span</code>
        matches a lot of elements! We try to avoid having key selectors that
        are <defn>tag</defn> or <defn>universal</defn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must also be aware which CSS properties trigger <defn>reflow</defn>,
        <defn>repaint</defn>, and <defn>compositing</defn>. We want to only
        apply proprties that trigger <defn>compositing</defn> (and avoid ones
        that trigger <defn>repaint</defn> and <defn>reflow</defn>, because
        those require the browser to do more work).
