        21. What is the CSS <defn>display</defn> property, and can you
        give a few examples of it's use?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The <defn>display</defn> property specifides how an element is
        displayed (the type of rendering box). Few examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <code>none</code>, <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code>,
          <code>inline-block</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <code>table</code>, <code>table-row</code>, <code>table-cell</code>,
          <code>list-item</code> (these let the element behave the like the
          respective html tags these refer to: <code>&gt;table&lt;</code>,
          <code>&gt;tr&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;td&lt;</code>,
          <code>&gt;li&lt;</code>)
        </p></li>

        22. What's the difference between <code>inline</code> and
        <code>inline-block</code>?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <defn>Resetting: </defn> gets completely rid of the default browser
        styling of elements. This means that you have to re-declare all rules
        from scratch, even the basic ones!
      </p>
      <p>
        <defn>Normalizing: </defn> doesn't get rid of all default styling.
        Rather, it keeps the 'useful' ones. It also corrects some browser bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which to choose? Use reset if we are designing an unconventional
        site, and normalize otherwise.

        3. Describe <defn>floats</defn> and how they work.
      </h3>
      <p>
        <defn>Float</defn> is a css positioning property. <code>float</code> can
        take a value of <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> which stick the
        elements in those directions respectively. Floated elements remain in
        the <defn>flow </defn> of a page -- meaning they will affect the
        positioning of other elements. <code>float</code> can also takes values
        <code>none</code> and <code>inherit</code> , which are self explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a floated element A is inline beside a floated element B, you can
        use <code>clear</code> on any one of those elements to move it to the
        next line.
      </p>
      <p>
        If some elements contain only floated elements, then it will have 0
        height. We can fix this in a couple of ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Set the parent's content to <code>overflow: auto</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add an element with <code>clear: both</code> before the close
            of the container
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        4. Describe <defn>z-index</defn>, and how a <defn>stacking
        context</defn> is formed.
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>z-index</code> controls the vertical stacking order of elements.
        They only affect elements that don't have <code>position: static</code>
        (which is the default position property).
      </p>
      <p>
        When there is no <code>z-index</code> specified, then elements are
        stacked in the order that they appear in the DOM (top-level at the
        bottom). Elements that don't have <code>position: static</code> always
        appear on top over those that do.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <defn>stacking context</defn> is a parent element containing more
        elements. The <code>z-index</code> of a <defn>stacking context</defn>'s
        child elements are only relevent within their parent element (read:
        they don't affect other elements outside the
        <defn>stacking context</defn>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many ways to trigger a <defn>stacking context</defn>, such
        as having <code>opacity</code> less than 1, and <code>filter</code>
        that is not <code>none</code>

      <h3>5. Describe <defn>Block Formatting Context</defn> and how it
        works.</h3>
      <p>
        A <defn>Block Formatting Context</defn> is caused by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <code>float</code> value other than <code>none</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <code>position</code> value that isn't <code>static</code> or
            <code>none</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <code>display</code> value of <code>table-cell</code>,
          <code>table-caption</code>, <code>inline-block</code>, or
          <code>inline-flex</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <code>overflow</code> value that isn't <code>visible</code>.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each box element contained inside a <defn>BFC</defn> has its left side
        touching the left edge of the <defn>BFC.</defn>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, vertical margins on stacking elements don't take the sum of the
        margins. Instead, they take only the largest of the two, combining
        them to form a single margin.
      </p>

        6. What are the various <defn>clearing</defn> techniques and which is
        appropriate for each context?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is about floated elements. You can clear them by using:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
            An empty <code>div</code> with <code>clear: both</code>.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            The <code>clearfix</code> class.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            <code>overflow: auto</code> or <code>overflow: hidden</code>, which
            establishes a BFC.
        </p></li>

        7. How would you approach fixing browser-specific styling issues?
      </h3>
      <p>You can fix these issues by using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          A separate stylesheet that loads only for a specific browser.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Libraries that do this for you, such as <defn>Bootstrap</defn>
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <defn>Reset CSS</defn> or <defn>Normalize CSS</defn>
        </p></li>

      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <defn>Graceful degradation: </defn> build the web-app for modern

        9. What are the different ways to <defn>visually hide content</defn>

      <p>Some ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <code>visibility: hidden</code>, where element will still take up
          space.

          <code>width: 0, height: 0</code>, where element won't take up space.

        <li><p>
          <code>position: absolute, left: -9999px</code>, where element is
          taken off the flow of the page, and positioned off-screen.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
