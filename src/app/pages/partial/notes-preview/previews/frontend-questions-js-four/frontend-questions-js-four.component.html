        32. Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the <defn>global scope
        </defn> of a website as-is, and never touch it?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Every script has access to the <defn>global scope</defn>. If any of
        the variables there are modified, then the multiple scrips that rely
        on them, may not work as expected. In order to avoid these collissions,
        variables should be <defn>encapsulated</defn> to a local namespace
        (<defn>IIFE</defn>s can be used for this.)

        33. Why would you use the <code>load</code> event? Does this event have
        disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The window <code>load</code> event fires when both the HTML document
        has <defn>finished parsing</defn>, and its <defn>resources</defn> have
        <defn>downloaded</defn>. It is ideal to use <code>load</code> when
        executing a function that needs the HTML document as well as its
        resources all ready. The disadvantage is that this approach may take
        longer than necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        An alternative is using the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event, which
        fires when the HTML document has <defn>finished parsing</defn>. It
        <defn>doesn't wait</defn> for its resources to finish downloading.
        Thus, it is ideal to use <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> when executing
        a function that only needs the HTML document to have finished (not
        necessarily with its resources.)

        34. Explain what a <defn>single page app</defn> is and how to make one
        <defn>SEO-friendly</defn>.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Traditionally (earlier days of web-app development), the browser
        recieves complete HTML from the server. The browser's only job is to
        <defn>render</defn> that HTML page. When a user navigates to another
        url, then a <defn>page refresh</defn> is required, fetching a new
        HTML page to be re-rendered. This is called <defn>server-side rendering
        </defn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have <defn>page refreshes</defn>, we don't consider that web-app
        as a <defn>single page app</defn>. For <defn>SPA</defn>s, we use
        <defn>client-side rendering</defn>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <defn>Client-side rendering</defn>: browser loads the initial page, and
        <defn>downloads</defn> all its <defn>scripts and resources</defn>
        (frameworks, libraries, stylesheets).
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever new content is to be displayed on the page, we <defn>don't
        </defn> perform a page refresh. Instead, we use the <defn>History API
        </defn>, and new data is retrieved from the server via
        <defn>AJAX</defn>. It is the job of the browser to process and render
        data from the server, and <defn>dynamically</defn> update the page.
      </p>
      <p>Advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          App feels <defn>responsive</defn> and has a smoother experience.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <defn>Fewer HTTP requests</defn>, because scripts and other resources
          don't have to be re-downloaded on every page refresh.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <defn>Separation</defn> between <defn>client</defn> and
          <defn>server</defn>, allowing each to have separate code-bases, and
          responsibilites.
        </p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>
          <defn>Heavier initial page load</defn> because scripts and resources
          required for future pages are also downloaded.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Requirement to <defn>configure routes</defn> to a single entry point
          because all routing requests are to be handled by the client.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          <defn>Reliance on JavaScript</defn>, because some search engines
          don't enable JavaScript during <defn>web-crawling</defn>. This
          will hurt the <defn>SEO</defn> of a page. As a work-around, we can
          use services that "pre-render" a static version of the site, to be
          given to web-crawlers.
