        32. Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the <defn>global scope
        </defn> of a website as-is, and never touch it?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Every script has access to the <defn>global scope</defn>. If any of
        the variables there are modified, then the multiple scrips that rely
        on them, may not work as expected. In order to avoid these collissions,
        variables should be <defn>encapsulated</defn> to a local namespace
        (<defn>IIFE</defn>s can be used for this.)

        33. Why would you use the <code>load</code> event? Does this event have
        disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The window <code>load</code> event fires when both the HTML document
        has <defn>finished parsing</defn>, and its <defn>resources</defn> have
        <defn>downloaded</defn>. It is ideal to use <code>load</code> when
        executing a function that needs the HTML document as well as its
        resources all ready. The disadvantage is that this approach may take
        longer than necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        An alternative is using the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event, which
        fires when the HTML document has <defn>finished parsing</defn>. It
        <defn>doesn't wait</defn> for its resources to finish downloading.
        Thus, it is ideal to use <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> when executing
        a function that only needs the HTML document to have finished (not
        necessarily with its resources.)
