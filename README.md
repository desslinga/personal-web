# PersonalWeb

This is my personal website, which is a project built with Angular (7.0.4).
If you see any errors, feel free to let me know or open a pull request. I'd
really appreciate it.

A stable version here : [fideslinga.com](http://fideslinga.com/)

#### What I use

Here is a list of things I use in building this website.
1. [**Angular (7)**](https://angular.io/)
As a container for my website, and making transitions easy.
2. [**SCSS**](https://sass-lang.com/)
As my CSS syntax.
3. [**Bootstrap (4)**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
To layout my website in a consistent way.
4. [**body-scroll-lock**](http://fideslinga.com/closeter/)
To help with some overlay content.

#### Check it out

Before anything, ensure that you've installed the required dependencies running
`npm-install` in the root folder (personal-web).

Run `ng serve` in the root folder (personal-web) for a development server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see my website!

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
